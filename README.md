### Description<br>
<p>This project was created as part of my educational process at [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather). <br>
It consists of only three files <code>home.html</code>, <code>main.css</code>, and <code>main.js</code>
Additional files like <code>composer.json</code>, and <code>index.php</code> were created exclusively to help deploy this app to heroku services.</p>

### Usage<br>
This app is absolutely free for you to use.
All you need is to fork, clown, or download this repo to your workspace and start <code>home.html</code> file.
I used three APIs while creating this app:
- [HTML5 Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation)
- [FCC Weather API](https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/)
- [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation)
All of them are absolutely free, though in order to use Unsplash API, you need to register and create your app there. Your app ID you will need to insert in <code>line 37</code> of <code>main.js</code> file.
